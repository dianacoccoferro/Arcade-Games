# 1- It has been defined that x must be a float
# 2- In an if statement, we must use a double equal sign
# 3- The if statement is missing the colon
# The correct code would be:
x = float(input("Enter a number: "))

# 1- The program is looking at a variable a, which has not been defined. It should look at variable answer.
# 2- In an if statement, we must use a double equal sign.
# 3- else should not be indented
# 4- it would be important to take into consideration case sensitivity
